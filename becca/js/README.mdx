# Hello, world!

## Constants and Variables

export const test = f => { try { return f() } catch (e) { return _jsxs(_Fragment, {children: [`${e}`, <br></br>]}) } };

export function constant()
{
    const constant = 1;
    constant = 2;
    return constant
}

export function variable()
{
    let variable = 1;
    variable = 2;
    return variable
}

this is an example of a declaration of a variable in js:
```javascript
let variable = 1;
number = 2;
```
<fieldset>> {test(variable)}</fieldset>

this is an example of declaration of a constant in js:
```javascript
const constant = 1;
number = 2;
```
<fieldset>> {test(constant)}</fieldset>
<i>notice that this action results in an error and the constant remains unchanged</i>

multiple variables can also be declared in the same line:
```javascript
let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
```

variables can be declared without a value:
```javascript
let a;
```

a value can be passed to multiple variables:
```javascript
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = 3;
```

## Types

javascript doesn't have explicit support for types, different from typescript, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have it in some sort of way.

```javascript
let a = 1;                  // number

let b = "hello"             // string

let c = true                // boolean

let d = [1, 2, 3];          // Array: list of values

let e = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}  // Object: list of classified values
```

## Native Funcions

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")  // this prints the input into the terminal
```
